TODO List for Debian package
----------------------------

 * Activate an autorestart button just after a new version of the package has
   been automatically installed.
 * Optionally preload jemalloc allocator if only available. Telegram Desktop
   does not properly configure default memory allocator from glibc. And so
   there is a heavy heap fragmentation in chats and channels with many videos.
 * Better Wayland integration. XWayland is still preferred due to a bug[1] with
   window edges. Keep in mind Telegram Desktop on Wayland has less features
   than on X.org. In particular, it is not allowed to set a global key for fast
   unmuting microphone in voice chats.
