 The Qt Company LGPL Exception version 1.1:
 As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License version

           structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and templates;
           and
     (iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General
           Public License version 2.1.

 Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the Library,
 provided that such modification does not involve copying material from the
 Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is

 accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of five lines
 or less in length.
