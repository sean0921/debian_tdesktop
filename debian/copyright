 The Qt Company LGPL Exception version 1.1:
 As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License version

 material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may distribute
 such object code under terms of your choice, provided that:

     (ii)  the incorporated material is limited to numerical parameters, data
           structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and templates;
           and
     (iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General
           Public License version 2.1.

 accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of five lines
 or less in length.

 Furthermore, you are not required to apply this additional permission to a
 modified version of the Library.
